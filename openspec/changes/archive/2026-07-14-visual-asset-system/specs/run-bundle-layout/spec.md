## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Visual-style directory optionally includes assets subdirectory

The canonical `2_backbone/visual-style/` directory MAY contain an `assets/` subdirectory. When present, it SHALL contain `asset-manifest.yaml`, `svg/`, `reference/`, and `icons/`. `renderTree()` SHALL include this subtree in its output regardless of whether a given deck has populated it — the tree describes the canonical structure, not runtime state. The whitelist `_ALLOWED_IN_VISUAL_STYLE` SHALL include `assets` as an allowed entry so that decks with assets pass validation. A new whitelist `_ALLOWED_IN_ASSETS` SHALL define the allowed contents of the `assets/` directory. Decks without an `assets/` directory SHALL pass `checkBundle()` without error — the directory is optional infrastructure.

#### Scenario: renderTree shows assets directory

- **WHEN** Agent inspects `renderTree()` output
- **THEN** the tree includes `assets/` under `visual-style/`
- **AND** includes `asset-manifest.yaml`, `svg/`, `reference/`, and `icons/`

#### Scenario: Assets directory is whitelisted in visual-style

- **WHEN** `checkBundle()` validates a deck with an `assets/` directory under `visual-style/`
- **THEN** the `assets/` directory itself passes validation (is in the whitelist)
- **AND** only canonical entries inside `assets/` are accepted

#### Scenario: Deck without assets directory passes validation

- **WHEN** `checkBundle()` validates a deck that has no `assets/` directory under `visual-style/`
- **THEN** validation passes without error
- **AND** no "missing assets directory" message is emitted

#### Scenario: Unexpected entry in assets directory is flagged

- **WHEN** a run bundle has a manually created unexpected file in `visual-style/assets/`
- **THEN** `checkBundle()` reports it as an unexpected entry

### Requirement: Path resolvers provide assets directory access

`bundle_layout.mjs` SHALL export `assetsDir(runDir)` resolving to the assets directory path (via `resolveBackboneAsset`, checking override first). It SHALL also export `resolveAssetPath(runDir, relpath)` resolving a relative path from the assets directory. Both SHALL follow the existing override-first-then-backbone resolution pattern.

#### Scenario: assetsDir resolves to backbone by default

- **WHEN** `assetsDir(runDir)` is called on a version with no asset overrides
- **THEN** the returned path is `{deckRoot}/2_backbone/visual-style/assets/`

#### Scenario: resolveAssetPath follows override-first pattern

- **WHEN** `resolveAssetPath(runDir, "svg/diagram.svg")` is called
- **AND** a version override exists at `3_versions/v{n}/overrides/visual-style/assets/svg/diagram.svg`
- **THEN** the override path is returned, not the backbone path
