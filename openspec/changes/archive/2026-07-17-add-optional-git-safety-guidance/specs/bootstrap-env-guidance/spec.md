## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: BOOTSTRAP provides optional, scope-honest Git startup guidance

BOOTSTRAP.md Step 1 SHALL contain a `### git` section synchronized to the `environment-check` base check name. The section SHALL say that Git is optional for producing PPTs but recommended for user-owned source history and comparison, and that a Git-only warning permits continuing after the existing hard requirements pass. It SHALL explain that doctor observes only the directory from which it was invoked; its result does not prove that a future or separately located deck has Git protection.

The section SHALL include copy-pasteable installation and `git --version` verification commands for macOS, Linux, and Windows. It SHALL distinguish the existing coding-agent path (verify first; an absent Git executable is an optional install) from the bare-metal path (platform installation guidance), consistent with the general BOOTSTRAP profile contract. It SHALL explain that, when a user wants Git protection for a deck, the Agent and user first identify and explicitly confirm a project root containing the desired source before any user-chosen `git init`. If the Agent needs to inspect whether that target root is already inside a worktree, it SHALL obtain separate explicit authorization for that named inspection and scope; doctor does not answer it. It SHALL explicitly prohibit initialization inside `_generated/` or a single `3_versions/vN/` leaf, and SHALL say that an existing ancestor worktree must not receive a nested initialization. An unconfirmed-worktree or no-verifiable-history warning SHALL be explained as non-blocking; a first checkpoint is a user choice, not a doctor repair step. The section SHALL not direct a user to run `git status` as an environment-repair diagnostic.

#### Scenario: Agent maps Git warning to self-contained guidance

- **WHEN** doctor reports `△ git: warn`
- **THEN** the Agent finds the matching `### git` section in BOOTSTRAP Step 1
- **AND** tells the user that work may continue while offering the applicable install, current-directory, or safe-root explanation

#### Scenario: Beginner receives platform-specific Git setup commands

- **WHEN** a user has no usable Git executable
- **THEN** the BOOTSTRAP `git` section provides labeled macOS, Linux, and Windows installation commands plus `git --version` verification
- **AND** it does not require Node.js, Image2 credentials, a Git remote, or a commit to complete the Git setup advice

#### Scenario: Current worktree is not confused with deck protection

- **WHEN** doctor identifies its current invocation directory as inside a worktree
- **THEN** BOOTSTRAP guidance tells the Agent not to infer that a later or separately located deck is tracked
- **AND** it requires a user-confirmed project root before recommending a user-run initialization for that deck

#### Scenario: Existing worktree avoids nested initialization

- **WHEN** the user has confirmed that the intended project root is already inside an existing worktree
- **THEN** BOOTSTRAP guidance tells the Agent not to run a nested `git init`
- **AND** does not treat the detected worktree or a first commit as a requirement to create or continue a deck

### Requirement: Git checkpoint guidance is recommendation-only and context-bounded

BOOTSTRAP and its Agent-facing startup guidance SHALL permit an Agent to make at most one concise, user-owned source-checkpoint recommendation per continuous source-work episode after initial real source authoring, before an important structural change when the Agent knows from current interaction that it edited meaningful source, after a validated vNext, or at final delivery/archival. The guidance SHALL define an episode as the current interaction's continuous substantive source work for one deck; a decline or deferral suppresses every further reminder until that episode ends, and a later interaction or different deck begins a new episode. The guidance SHALL state that this recommendation is not authorization and does not require hidden working-tree inspection.

The Agent and framework SHALL NOT automatically initialize a repository, stage files, commit, push, pull, change a remote, run a Git restore/reset/checkout/clean/read-tree operation, discard working-tree changes, inspect worktree cleanliness, or require a clean worktree. After explicit user authorization for a named Git operation and user-supplied scope, an Agent MAY assist with that exact operation; it SHALL restate that operation and scope and SHALL NOT infer files, staged changes, or effect from hidden inspection. Ordinary checkpoint authorization does not authorize `git status`, `git diff`, or another inspection, each of which requires separately named user direction and scope. This change supplies no Git-history reader, automated source replacement, or default recovery protocol. Absent authorization it SHALL not mutate Git state. A user who declines Git installation, initialization, or checkpoint work SHALL continue the applicable deck workflow after existing hard gates pass.

#### Scenario: Agent recommends but does not create a checkpoint

- **WHEN** an Agent reaches a stated checkpoint opportunity and knows from the current interaction that source work has occurred
- **THEN** it may explain the value of preserving user-owned source history and ask whether the user wants a Git action
- **AND** neither doctor nor the pipeline probes worktree cleanliness, creates a repository, or creates a commit as a side effect

#### Scenario: User declines Git setup or checkpoint

- **WHEN** a user declines installation, initialization, or a checkpoint
- **THEN** the Agent continues the applicable deck workflow after existing hard gates pass
- **AND** it does not frame the decision as skipping Structural Versioning Path or source validation
