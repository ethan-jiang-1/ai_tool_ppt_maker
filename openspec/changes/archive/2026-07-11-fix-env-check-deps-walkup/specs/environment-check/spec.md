## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: npm and dependency check

The env check SHALL verify npm is available. It SHALL verify that the hard-required packages `@napi-rs/canvas`, `pptxgenjs`, and `commander` are each present by walking **upward from `process.cwd()`** (the same upward-search strategy used for `.env` loading) and checking for `node_modules/<package>` under each ancestor. Presence MAY be determined by filesystem checks (consistent with the current checker). The checker SHALL NOT stop at the first ancestor that merely contains a `node_modules` directory if a required package path is missing there — it SHALL continue upward (Node-like). If no ancestor yields a given required package, that check SHALL fail and instruct the user to run `npm install` in the project root (the directory that owns `package.json` / `node_modules`).

#### Scenario: Dependencies installed at project root while cwd is a deck

- **WHEN** `node_modules` with the required packages exists at a parent of `process.cwd()` (for example repo root)
- **AND** the checker is invoked with `cwd` set to a child deck directory that has no local `node_modules`
- **THEN** the dependency checks for `@napi-rs/canvas`, `pptxgenjs`, and `commander` report status `ok`

#### Scenario: Dependencies missing

- **WHEN** no ancestor of `process.cwd()` contains `node_modules/<package>` for a required package
- **THEN** that dependency check reports failure
- **AND** the fix text instructs the user to run `npm install` in the project root

#### Scenario: Dependencies at cwd still work

- **WHEN** `node_modules` with the required packages exists directly in `process.cwd()`
- **THEN** `@napi-rs/canvas`, `pptxgenjs`, and `commander` are verified as present

#### Scenario: Empty local node_modules does not block parent packages

- **WHEN** `process.cwd()` contains an empty or incomplete `node_modules`
- **AND** a parent directory contains `node_modules` with the required packages
- **THEN** the dependency checks for those packages still report status `ok`
